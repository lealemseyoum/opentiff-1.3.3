The configure scripts are only useful on UNIX-type systems. To
use, simply type the following at the command prompt:

prompt> ./configure
prompt> make


The configuration files that can be changed:

	opentiff/Makefile.am
	opentiff/configure.in
	opentiff/acconfig.h
	opentiff/config.h.in
	opentiff/bootstrap
	
	opentiff/src/Makefile.am

	Custom m4 macros:
	opentiff/config-scripts/ac_compile_ansi.m4 	- check/set ansi mode
	opentiff/config-scripts/ac_compile_warning.m4	- turn on full warning mode
	opentiff/config-scripts/ac_sys_posix.m4		- set POSIX mode


Automatically generated configuration files 
that are not to be changed:

	opentiff/configure		- generated by autoconf from configure.in
	opentiff/libtool			- generated by autoconf

	opentiff/config-scripts/depcomp		- used by automake / Makefile
	opentiff/config-scripts/install-sh	- used by automake / Makefile
	opentiff/config-scripts/config.guess	- used by autoconf
	opentiff/config-scripts/config.sub	- used by autoconf
	opentiff/config-scripts/ltconfig		- used by libtool
	opentiff/config-scripts/ltmain.sh		- used by libtool
	opentiff/config-scripts/missing		- used by automake / autoconf
	opentiff/config-scripts/mkinstalldirs	- used by automake / Makefile

	opentiff/Makefile.in	- generated by automake
	opentiff/src/Makefile.in	- generated by automake

	opentiff/Makefile		- generated by configure
	opentiff/src/Makefile	- generated by configure

Once a configuration file is changed, run the following
commands from within the opentiff root directory:

	-> ./bootstrap
	-> ./configure

this will update the configuration and Makefiles.

NOTE: must use automake v1.4a or greater
